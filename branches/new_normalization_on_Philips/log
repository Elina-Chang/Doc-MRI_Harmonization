our goal: to choose a ideal cutoff value.
our principle: to try out several cutoff ratio, and find one minimizing the std calculated by first order feature value.
our steps: 1. ;
           2. ;
           3. feature extraction of the t2_sag_forFeatureExtractor and womb_roi_forFeatureExtractor, and get .csv file;
           4. read .csv file to calculate std;
           5. plot a scatter map to show those std values.
our experiments: 1. calculate std on the feature value in Philips_ori_image_type_original(18).csv.
